A large flock of seagulls dominates the foreground, densely packed together and scattered across the light-colored sand. These birds, primarily in shades of gray with white accents, are in various poses \u2013 some standing upright, others leaning or looking out towards the water. The sand itself is speckled with small pebbles and shells, adding texture to the scene. \n\nBehind the gulls, a calm, turquoise ocean stretches out to the horizon. Gentle waves are visible, creating a subtle white foam along the shoreline. The lighting appears to be soft and diffused, likely from an overcast day, which evenly illuminates the scene. The overall composition is balanced, with the seagulls creating a sense of movement and activity against the stillness of the water. The color palette is dominated by the blues and greens of the ocean, contrasted by the neutral tones of the sand and the gray of the birds, creating a peaceful and natural atmosphere.",
