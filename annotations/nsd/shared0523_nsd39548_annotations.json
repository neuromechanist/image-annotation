A young African elephant calf stands prominently in the foreground, its large, floppy ears and trunk reaching out towards a human hand. The calf is a soft, dusty grey color, with patches of mud clinging to its skin, adding to its endearing appearance. \n\nA dark-skinned man wearing a green rain jacket and black rubber boots stands beside the calf, gently offering its trunk a treat. The lighting is soft and diffused, likely overcast, creating a gentle, even illumination across the scene. The composition is balanced, with the calf and the man occupying the central space, drawing the viewer's eye to the interaction.
