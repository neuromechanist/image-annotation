A solitary cross-country skier is mid-stride, moving forward on a snow-covered road. The skier is wearing a black jacket and a blue and white patterned hat, and is holding poles with red straps. Two skis are visible beneath their feet, with the tracks clearly imprinted in the fresh snow. The road is partially covered in ice, reflecting the muted daylight. \n\nBehind the skier is a modest, green-painted single-story house with a dark roof and a small chimney. A weathered wooden fence runs along the side of the house. The overall color palette is dominated by cool tones \u2013 gray, white, and muted greens \u2013 creating a calm and quiet atmosphere. The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast day. The composition is simple and focused, with the skier as the central subject, drawing the viewer's eye into the scene. The depth of field is shallow, blurring the background slightly and emphasizing the skier's movement.",

The main element is the skier, seen from the back, clad in black ski attire and a vibrant blue and white patterned head covering.

The dominant color is white, from the pervasive snow cover, contrasted by the dark clothing of the skier and the red skis. The house is a muted green.
