The walls are painted a warm, creamy beige, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. The focal point is a dark reddish-brown vanity top, likely made of wood, supporting a round, white porcelain sink with a brushed nickel faucet. The vanity is bordered by vertical, paneled wood trim, adding to the traditional feel. Above the vanity, a light wood-framed medicine cabinet hangs, providing storage. \n\nTwo ornate, antique-style wall sconces with curved arms flank the mirror, casting a soft, warm light. A small, wooden shelf sits above the sink, holding a patterned ceramic soap dish. A small, partially visible window with a stained glass design is located on the left side of the frame, allowing a glimpse of greenery outside. The overall composition is simple and uncluttered, emphasizing the warmth and character of the space.",

The walls are painted a warm beige, and the vanity is set into a wall panelled with light-colored wood. A small, frosted window is visible to the right, letting in natural light and revealing a glimpse of a leafy, green outdoor scene. The window and the light it casts contribute to the overall feeling of a comfortable, slightly vintage space.
