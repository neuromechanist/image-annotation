His dark hair is slightly messy, and he's wearing a blue baseball cap. \n\nThe skateboard itself is a classic white deck with black wheels. The background is filled with a crowd of spectators, including children and adults, all watching the action. Several people are wearing sunglasses and sporting casual clothing. The lighting is bright and overcast, creating soft shadows and evenly illuminating the scene.
