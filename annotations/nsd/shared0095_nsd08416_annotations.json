The tower is constructed from light gray stone, giving it a classical and timeless appearance. The main elements include the clock faces, which are framed by intricate gold detailing, adding a touch of luxury and contrast to the otherwise neutral tones. The clock faces are circular with Roman numerals, and the hands are a dark blue, which stands out against the lighter background of the clock face. The tower features multiple levels, each adorned with decorative elements such as small statues and ornate railings, contributing to its grandeur. The lighting is even and bright, suggesting a daytime setting with no visible shadows, which highlights the architectural details and the metallic accents. The overall composition is symmetrical, with the clock faces positioned centrally on the tower, drawing the viewer's eye directly to the focal point of the structure. The simplicity of the background ensures that the tower is the sole subject of the image, allowing its intricate details and historical charm to be fully appreciated.",

The lighting is soft and diffused due to the overcast sky, casting subtle shadows and highlighting the textures of the stone. The composition is vertically oriented, emphasizing the tower's height and imposing presence.

The sky\u2019s lack of color and texture serves to isolate the tower, drawing the viewer\u2019s attention directly to its grandeur.
