The tower is constructed of light beige stone, exhibiting a robust, layered design with multiple levels and decorative moldings. Several arched windows punctuate the stone fa\u00e7ade, offering glimpses into the interior. Two large, circular clock faces dominate the upper portion of the tower, their dials featuring Roman numerals and ornate hands.  Each clock face displays the time, though the exact numbers are obscured. \n\nThe lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon. The sky is a pale, clear blue, providing a stark contrast to the warm tones of the stone.  The overall composition is symmetrical, with the tower centered in the frame.  Small, dark lights are positioned along the edges of the tower, likely for illumination at night. The architectural details, combined with the serene sky, create a sense of timelessness and civic grandeur.",

Two large clock faces dominate the central section, displaying a traditional Roman numeral dial and ornate hands. The tower ascends in tiers, culminating in a smaller, ornate upper section with a pointed roof. The sky is a clear, pale blue, providing a simple backdrop. The lighting appears to be soft and diffused, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon, casting subtle shadows that accentuate the texture of the stone. Several birds are perched on the ledges and roof, adding a touch of life to the scene. The composition is symmetrical and focuses entirely on the tower, emphasizing its height and grandeur.
