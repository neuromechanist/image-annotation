The waves are a chaotic mix of white foam and darker water, creating a sense of movement and power. Behind the waves, a rugged, dark rock face forms the backdrop, adding to the wild and untamed atmosphere. \n\nDominating the scene is a large, glossy black bird \u2013 likely a cormorant \u2013 captured mid-flight. Its wings are fully extended, showcasing their impressive span, and its body is angled upwards, suggesting it\u2019s diving or soaring. The lighting is bright and diffused, likely from an overcast sky, which evenly illuminates the scene.

A large, dark bird, likely a seagull or similar seabird, is in mid-flight, wings fully extended, skimming low over a foamy, turbulent wave. The wave itself is a mass of white, frothy water, with hints of tan and brown beneath the surface, suggesting a sandy seabed. The foreground is a dark, wet, and smooth surface, likely the beach itself, providing a stark contrast to the chaotic energy of the wave. \n\nThe lighting appears bright and natural, illuminating the white foam and creating strong shadows under the bird's wings. The color palette is dominated by whites, grays, and blacks, with subtle earth tones in the wave. The composition is dynamic, with the bird positioned slightly off-center, drawing the eye across the frame and emphasizing its movement.
