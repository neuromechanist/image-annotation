The walls are covered in square, glossy white tiles, creating a clean and minimalist aesthetic. A dark gray or black tiled floor provides a contrasting base. A white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet sits on a dark wooden shelf, positioned against the wall. Above the sink is a chrome-finished showerhead attached to a flexible hose. A white towel hangs neatly beside the showerhead. \n\nA small, chrome-finished candle holder with two white candles is mounted on the wall next to the sink. A white towel is neatly folded on the shelf below the sink. The lighting appears to be soft and diffused, likely from an overhead light source, casting gentle shadows. The overall composition is simple and functional, emphasizing the clean lines and neutral color palette. The mirror in the background reflects the space, further reinforcing the impression of a small, well-maintained bathroom.",
