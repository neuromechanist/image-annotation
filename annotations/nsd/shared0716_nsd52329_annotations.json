The main focus is the stir-fry itself, featuring tender, diced pieces of browned pork, likely marinated and stir-fried until slightly crispy. Scattered amongst the pork are bright green stalks of broccoli, and what appears to be sliced mushrooms, adding textural variety. A single, vibrant red bell pepper slice is prominently positioned, contributing a pop of color. \n\nThe lighting is soft and diffused, highlighting the textures of the ingredients. The overall composition is balanced, with the stir-fry taking up the majority of the plate. The colors are rich and saturated \u2013 the browns of the pork, the greens of the broccoli, and the red of the pepper create a visually appealing contrast.
