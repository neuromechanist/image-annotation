The dominant feature is the imposing Gothic architecture of the Palace of Westminster, with its intricate stonework and towering spires. The clock tower, commonly known as Big Ben, stands prominently, displaying a clear, circular clock face with Roman numerals. The building is primarily constructed of warm, golden-brown sandstone, reflecting the sunlight. The sky is a bright, pale blue with scattered, fluffy white clouds, creating a pleasant, summery atmosphere. \n\nThe river reflects the building's grandeur, adding to the sense of scale. To the right, a modern building with a dark grey facade provides a contrasting element. The lighting is bright and even, casting subtle shadows that accentuate the building\u2019s architectural details.
