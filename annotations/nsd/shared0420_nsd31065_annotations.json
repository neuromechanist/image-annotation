A young boy, wearing blue shorts and a white t-shirt, stands on a vibrant green lawn, holding a bright blue and white kite aloft. Behind him, a small, brown dog sits attentively, watching the kite. The expansive body of water, a deep turquoise blue, stretches out to the horizon, reflecting the bright sky. A dense line of dark green trees forms the distant shoreline, creating a strong horizontal element that anchors the composition. \n\nThe sky is a clear, pale blue with scattered, fluffy white clouds, suggesting a sunny day.
