The man is dressed in formal attire, featuring a crisp white dress shirt and a neatly knotted gray tie, which contrasts subtly with the white shirt. His short, reddish-brown hair is neatly styled, and he wears rectangular-framed glasses that reflect a faint light, possibly from a computer screen or overhead lighting. The lighting in the room is even and bright, likely from fluorescent ceiling lights, casting soft shadows and highlighting the subject's features without creating harsh contrasts.
