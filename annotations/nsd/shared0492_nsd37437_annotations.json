The bridge, with its sturdy concrete pillars and the vehicles moving across it, dominates the middle ground, serving as a visual anchor and a symbol of human engineering. Beyond the bridge, the lush greenery of the trees and the expansive sky filled with fluffy white clouds create a tranquil backdrop. The sky's vastness and the softness of the clouds give a sense of openness and calm, which contrasts with the busyness of the foreground.
