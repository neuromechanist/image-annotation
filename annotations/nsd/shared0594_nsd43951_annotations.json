A large, gray Coast Guard cutter, an HC-130 Hercules, dominates the background, its distinctive orange tail fin prominently displayed against a bright blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The aircraft is positioned on a dark, asphalt runway, indicated by painted yellow lines extending towards the viewer. Two uniformed Coast Guard personnel, one wearing a light green flight suit and the other a darker green, are walking away from the camera, carrying large, dark green duffel bags. They both hold water bottles, suggesting a break or a moment of rest. \n\nThe lighting is bright and even, casting long, sharp shadows from the aircraft and the personnel. The overall composition is balanced, with the aircraft and the figures creating a sense of scale and activity. The colors are dominated by the gray of the aircraft, the blue of the sky, and the green of the uniforms, creating a practical and functional visual.",
