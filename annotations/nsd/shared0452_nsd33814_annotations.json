The bananas are tightly packed, creating a dense, textured mass that fills much of the frame. Behind the bananas, blurred figures of shoppers and vendors can be seen, adding to the sense of a busy marketplace. \n\nThe lighting is bright and natural, suggesting an outdoor setting, with sunlight casting a warm glow on the bananas.

The composition is slightly off-center, with a man\u2019s face partially visible on the left, adding a human element to the scene.
