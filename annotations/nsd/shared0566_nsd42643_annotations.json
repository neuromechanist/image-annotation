The ground is a warm, ochre-colored sand, speckled with small stones and loose dirt, suggesting a natural habitat. A large, weathered log lies partially in the foreground, providing a natural barrier and adding depth to the composition. The zebras themselves are strikingly patterned with bold black and white stripes, a classic zebra design. The adult zebras are tall and muscular, while the foal is noticeably smaller and more delicate. \n\nThe lighting is bright and even, casting soft shadows and highlighting the texture of the zebras' coats. The overall composition is balanced, with the zebras arranged in a loose triangular formation. The foal is positioned close to the adult zebras, suggesting a protective bond.

The zebras exhibit the classic black and white striped pattern, creating a striking contrast against the warm-toned ground.
