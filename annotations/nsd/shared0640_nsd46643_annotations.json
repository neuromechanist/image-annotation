Twelve plump blueberry muffins are nestled within the tin, each boasting a golden-brown exterior speckled with dark, juicy blueberries. The muffins themselves have a slightly irregular, rustic shape, with some exhibiting a slightly domed top and others a flatter, more rounded form. The blueberries are generously embedded throughout the batter, adding a vibrant contrast to the muffin\u2019s color. \n\nBehind the muffin tin sits a large, stainless steel oven with dark gray control knobs. A silver, perforated metal colander rests on the counter to the left, partially visible. The lighting is warm and diffused, suggesting natural light perhaps from a window. The overall composition is straightforward and inviting, focusing on the baked goods. The colors are dominated by warm browns, blues, and grays, creating a comforting and appetizing scene. The image evokes a sense of home baking and freshly made treats.",
