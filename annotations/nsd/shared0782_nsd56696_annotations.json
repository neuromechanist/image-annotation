The toddler is holding a pink and white hairbrush adorned with Mickey Mouse images, attempting to brush their own hair. The child is wearing a white dress with a vibrant orange and white ruffled collar and sleeves, further embellished with small Mickey Mouse patterns. Their expression is somewhat serious, with a slight frown and focused gaze directed at their reflection. \n\nThe lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting natural light coming from an unseen window. The background is a plain, off-white wall, creating a clean and simple backdrop that emphasizes the child and the mirror. The mirror itself reflects the toddler's image, creating a doubled effect. The overall composition is centered, with the child and the mirror taking up the majority of the frame. The colors are bright and cheerful, dominated by the pink, white, and orange of the child\u2019s clothing and the hairbrush.",

The lighting is soft and natural, possibly from a nearby window, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the child's features and the mirror's reflective surface. The child, dressed in a white top adorned with colorful floral patterns, holds a small, pink-handled brush decorated with a Minnie Mouse design, which she uses to brush her hair or perhaps her face, as she gazes into the mirror. The mirror itself has a simple frame, and the reflection shows the child's face and the brush, creating a symmetrical composition that draws the viewer's eye into the scene. The overall color palette is soft and warm, dominated by the pastel tones of the child's clothing and the pink of the brush, which contrasts gently with the neutral tones of the wall and the frame.
