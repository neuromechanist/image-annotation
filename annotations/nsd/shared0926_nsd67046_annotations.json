The walls are a warm beige, creating a soft, neutral ambiance. A white door with a simple knob is visible on the left, and a white toilet sits on the right. The focal point is a white vanity with two drawers and a cabinet underneath, holding various toiletries like shampoo bottles, a soap dispenser, and a small trash can. A circular, patterned rug in shades of beige, brown, and green covers the floor. \n\nA large, rectangular mirror hangs above the vanity, reflecting the room and the contents within. A fluffy, pink towel is draped over a towel rack to the left of the mirror. The lighting appears to be from overhead, casting a soft glow. The overall composition is straightforward, presenting a clean and functional bathroom space. The arrangement of the elements is organized, suggesting a tidy and well-maintained environment.",
