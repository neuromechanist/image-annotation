A large, white marble-like island dominates the center of the space, providing ample workspace and seating. Above the island, open shelving displays a collection of decorative items, including plates and a ceramic vase. \n\nA stainless steel range hood is mounted above a professional-style gas range, while a stainless steel refrigerator stands to the left. The backsplash is a clean, white tile, and a small, black microwave sits on the countertop. The lighting is bright and even, likely from recessed ceiling lights, creating a welcoming atmosphere.
