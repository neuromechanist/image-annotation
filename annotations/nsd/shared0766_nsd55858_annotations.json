The background is blurred, with hints of red and green, possibly indicating a festive or outdoor setting, which contrasts with the soft, muted tones of the teddy bear and the child's clothing. The lighting is natural and soft, suggesting an overcast day or a shaded area, which enhances the gentle and serene mood of the image.
