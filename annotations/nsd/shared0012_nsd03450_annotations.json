The girl is wearing a bright pink one-piece swimsuit, emphasizing her youthful appearance. She\u2019s in a classic surfing stance \u2013 knees bent, leaning forward, and arms outstretched for balance. A black surfboard leash connects her board to her ankle. \n\nThe ocean is a mix of blues and greens, with gentle, rolling waves creating white foam at the crests.

The composition is balanced, with the girl\u2019s figure centered and the wave providing a dynamic background.

The lighting appears to be soft and natural, likely from an overcast day, as there are no harsh shadows. The color palette is dominated by blues and greens of the water, contrasted by the coral of the girl\u2019s clothing and the vibrant blue of the surfboard.
