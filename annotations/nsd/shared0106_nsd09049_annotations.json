The walls are painted a rich, medium brown, creating a cozy and somewhat vintage feel. A large, ornate, dark-brown vanity dominates the scene, featuring a deep, black marble countertop with a sleek, round sink and a chrome faucet. Above the vanity sits a tall, dark-brown cabinet, likely for storage. A chrome-framed mirror hangs above the vanity, reflecting the room and the lighting. \n\nThe lighting is provided by a dramatic, multi-armed chandelier with multiple cream-colored, bell-shaped shades, casting a warm glow. To the right of the vanity, a white toilet is visible, alongside a roll of toilet paper. A black, wrought-iron towel rack holds several neatly folded white towels. The overall composition is symmetrical and balanced, with a focus on the vanity and the warm color palette. The scene evokes a sense of relaxation and elegance.",
