The walls are painted a rich, medium brown, creating a cozy and somewhat vintage feel. A large, ornate, dark-brown vanity dominates the scene, featuring a deep, black marble countertop with a sleek, round sink and a chrome faucet. Above the vanity sits a tall, dark-brown cabinet, likely for storage. A chrome-framed mirror hangs above the vanity, reflecting the room and the lighting. \n\nThe lighting is provided by a dramatic, multi-armed chandelier with multiple cream-colored, bell-shaped shades, casting a warm glow. To the right of the vanity, a white toilet is visible, alongside a roll of toilet paper. A black, wrought-iron towel rack holds several neatly folded white towels. The overall composition is symmetrical and balanced, with a focus on the vanity and the warm color palette. The scene evokes a sense of relaxation and elegance.",

The countertop is a dark, polished stone, possibly granite, adding a touch of elegance. Above the sink, a large rectangular mirror reflects the room, enhancing the sense of space. A modern, multi-light chandelier with warm, yellowish bulbs hangs above the mirror, providing ample lighting and a soft, inviting glow.\n\nTo the right of the vanity, a white toilet is visible, accompanied by a neatly arranged set of toilet paper rolls. Above the toilet, a black metal towel rack holds neatly folded white towels, adding a touch of organization and comfort. The walls are painted in a warm, earthy beige tone, complementing the dark wood and creating a harmonious color palette. The floor appears to be covered in a light-colored, textured carpet, contributing to the warm and comfortable feel of the space.\n\nThe overall composition is balanced, with the dark vanity contrasting against the lighter walls and floor, creating visual interest. The lighting, primarily from the chandelier, casts a warm, welcoming light throughout the room, making it feel inviting and comfortable. The attention to detail, such as the neatly folded towels and the organized toiletries, suggests a well-maintained and thoughtfully designed space.",

To the right of the vanity, there is a white toilet with a roll of toilet paper placed on top. Above the toilet, a black metal shelf holds neatly folded white and yellow towels, contributing to the room's organized and clean appearance.
