Behind the bananas, there is a small, clear plastic container with a white lid, containing what appears to be a creamy substance, possibly yogurt or a similar dairy product. The container has a colorful label with text, though the specifics are not entirely clear. To the right of the bananas, there is a box of Post Grape-Nuts cereal. The box is predominantly white with a blue and red design, showcasing an image of the cereal mixed with berries and a bowl of the product. The lighting in the image is soft and natural, casting gentle shadows that enhance the texture of the wooden board and the items on it.
