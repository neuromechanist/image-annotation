The zebra is the dominant element, positioned slightly off-center to the right, and it\u2019s a magnificent specimen with a classic black and white striped pattern. Its coat is a rich, deep black, sharply contrasting with the bright white stripes that run vertically across its body. The zebra\u2019s head is lowered, and it appears to be grazing, with its long, dark tongue visible. \n\nThe background consists of lush, green foliage, suggesting a park-like setting. A gray concrete wall or fence is visible in the distance, partially obscured by the greenery. The lighting is bright and even, casting soft shadows and highlighting the zebra's texture. The overall composition is balanced, with the zebra\u2019s powerful form taking up a significant portion of the frame. The red banner at the top of the image is a distracting element.",

Lush green trees and foliage form a dense backdrop, suggesting a wooded area.
