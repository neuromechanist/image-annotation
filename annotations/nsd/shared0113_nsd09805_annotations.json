The dominant color scheme is a muted beige, used for the walls and countertop, which features a speckled, light beige pattern. The kitchen\u2019s focal point is a large, dark brown island countertop with a stainless steel sink and faucet. A gleaming, stainless steel range hood and oven are positioned against the wall, alongside a stainless steel range. Several stainless steel appliances contribute to the kitchen's sleek appearance. \n\nAbove the island, a decorative shelf holds several bottles and a framed picture. The lighting is warm and diffused, likely from recessed lights, casting a soft glow across the space. A window is visible in the background, adding a touch of natural light. The composition is balanced, with the island serving as the central element, and the appliances neatly arranged to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing kitchen. The overall impression is one of a comfortable and well-equipped cooking space.",

A cluster of bananas sits near a black appliance on the countertop, seemingly awaiting use. A stainless steel sink is positioned beneath a window, with a faucet extending over it. Behind the sink, dark wooden cabinets line the wall, creating a contrast with the warm beige walls. A collection of decorative items, including bottles and a framed piece of art, are displayed on a ledge above the cabinets, adding a personal touch to the space.
