The setting is a snowy mountain slope, with a clear blue sky dominating the upper portion of the frame, and the sun positioned high, casting sharp, elongated shadows of the skiers onto the pristine white snow. The main elements include a group of skiers in the foreground, dressed in colorful ski gear, which contrasts vividly against the white snow and the deep blue of the sky. They are positioned on a gentle slope, some standing still, others in motion, suggesting a casual, leisurely atmosphere. In the background, a ski lift with gondolas is visible, ascending the mountain, and a small building with a snow-covered roof is partially visible, possibly a lodge or rental shop. The trees, mostly bare, line the edges of the slope, adding a touch of green to the otherwise monochromatic landscape. The overall composition is dynamic yet balanced, with the skiers in the foreground drawing the viewer's eye towards the expansive, sunlit mountain in the background, creating a sense of depth and vastness. The lighting is bright and even, indicative of a clear day, enhancing the clarity and vibrancy of the scene.",

The snow on the ground is pristine, with ski tracks visible, adding texture and depth to the foreground.\n\nThe background elements consist of a ski resort setting with a ski lift visible on the left side of the image, which is a crucial element for transporting skiers up the mountain. The ski lift's cables stretch across the frame, connecting to a lift station that is partially visible. The background also features a mountainous landscape with a dense forest of evergreen trees, which are dark and contrast sharply with the bright snow and sky. The sun is positioned high in the sky, creating a bright glare and casting a soft light over the entire scene, which enhances the visibility of the skiers and the details of the landscape.

The skiers are silhouetted against the bright snow, with long shadows stretching behind them, indicating a low sun angle. Tracks from previous skiers crisscross the slope, creating a textured pattern. To the left, a small building is visible, likely a ski lodge or rental shop, with people gathered around. \n\nIn the background, a larger, tree-covered mountain rises, with a winding ski trail visible on its face. A ski lift is also visible, ascending the mountain, connecting the base area with the higher slopes. The sky is a clear, bright blue, and the sun is positioned high in the sky, creating a strong glare. The foreground and background are connected by the slope itself, which serves as the pathway for the skiers and snowboarders, leading their activity towards the larger mountain and the ski lift.",

Include only categories that contain detected items. If an attribute doesn't apply to an item (e.g., color for sky), omit that key rather than using null.
