The skiers are dressed in colorful winter gear, adding splashes of red, blue, and white against the white snow. In the midground, ski lifts with blue chairs are visible, hinting at the infrastructure of the resort. The background features a dense line of evergreen trees, their branches heavy with snow, creating a natural border against the sky.

The hillside is densely covered with snow, suggesting a winter setting, and the trees are silhouetted against the bright sky, creating a stark contrast. The ski lift structures, visible on the left side of the image, are partially obscured by the slope and the trees, indicating the infrastructure supporting the ski area. The sun, positioned high in the sky, casts long shadows across the snow, enhancing the depth and dimension of the scene.
