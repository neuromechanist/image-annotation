Four young men are the focal point, standing closely together in the foreground. They are all dressed in winter gear \u2013 one in a red and grey jacket, another in a blue jacket with a name tag, a third in a blue jacket, and the last in a grey jacket. Each wears a matching hat and gloves, and they are all sporting goggles. \n\nThe snow is thick and fresh, covering the ground and creating a bright white backdrop. The lighting is diffused, suggesting an overcast day, casting a soft, even illumination across the scene. The composition is informal, with the subjects leaning in towards the camera, creating a sense of camaraderie and fun.

They are grouped closely together, with three of them standing shoulder-to-shoulder and one slightly offset, all smiling broadly. Two are wearing snowboards strapped to their feet, while the other two have skis and poles. The individuals are dressed in winter gear, including hooded jackets, hats, and gloves, in a mix of blue, red, and grey tones. A ski lift tower and cables are visible in the background, suggesting a functional ski area. The snow appears deep and fresh, covering the ground and partially burying the equipment.
