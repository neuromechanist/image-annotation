A single, prominent white sheep stands prominently in the foreground, facing the camera with a direct gaze. Behind it, a flock of approximately eight other sheep are scattered across a lush, green field. The grass is vibrant and textured, with patches of sunlight illuminating its surface, creating a dappled effect. \n\nIn the background, two weathered, traditional barns stand side-by-side. They are constructed of dark brown wood and have steeply pitched roofs, typical of agricultural buildings. A wooden fence runs along the edge of the field, partially obscured by the sheep. The overall color palette is dominated by greens and browns, with the sheep providing a bright contrast. The lighting is warm and golden, casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the grass and buildings. The composition is balanced, with the central sheep drawing the viewer\u2019s eye while the surrounding sheep and barns contribute to a sense of a peaceful, working farm.",

The grass beneath it is a vibrant, lush green, speckled with patches of shadow, suggesting a gentle slope.
