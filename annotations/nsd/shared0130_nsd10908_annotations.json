The walls are painted a soft, creamy beige, creating a calming backdrop. The floor is covered in dark grey, rectangular tiles, adding a touch of sophistication. A large, white, oval-shaped bathtub dominates the space, positioned on a raised, dark grey tiled platform. The tub is equipped with chrome fixtures, including a faucet and handheld showerhead. \n\nA double vanity unit with dark wood cabinetry and sleek, silver-toned metal accents sits adjacent to the tub. The vanity features two sinks with chrome faucets and a sizable mirror above. Natural light streams in through a large window with a light-filtering shade, casting a gentle glow across the room. The lighting is a combination of natural and artificial, creating a comfortable ambiance. The composition is well-balanced, with the tub and vanity forming the central focal point, and the window providing a sense of depth and openness.",
