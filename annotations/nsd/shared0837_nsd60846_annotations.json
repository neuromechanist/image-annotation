A small table lamp with a beige lampshade sits on the side table, casting a warm glow. The lighting is soft and diffused, enhancing the room\u2019s comfortable and inviting feel.

To the right of the coffee table is a small side table with a lamp. A television is mounted on the wall, framed by a dark wooden border. The walls are painted a warm, golden yellow, creating a cozy atmosphere. A framed botanical print hangs on the wall to the left of the television.

The sofa is adorned with striped throw pillows in coordinating colors, adding texture and visual interest.\n\nAbove the sofa, a large black-framed mirror is mounted on the wall, reflecting part of the room and creating an illusion of depth. Flanking the mirror are two framed artworks featuring abstract, leaf-like designs in muted green and beige, complementing the room's color scheme. A flat-screen TV is mounted on the wall behind the mirror, blending seamlessly into the decor.\n\nThe room is illuminated by soft, warm lighting from two table lamps with white shades, placed on wooden side tables on either side of the sofa. The lamps cast a gentle glow, enhancing the room's inviting atmosphere. A wooden coffee table sits in front of the sofa, holding a remote control, a woven basket, and a red book, suggesting a lived-in and functional space. The overall composition is balanced, with symmetrical elements like the framed artworks and lamps contributing to a sense of harmony and order.
