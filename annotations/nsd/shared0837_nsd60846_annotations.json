A small table lamp with a beige lampshade sits on the side table, casting a warm glow. The lighting is soft and diffused, enhancing the room\u2019s comfortable and inviting feel.

To the right of the coffee table is a small side table with a lamp. A television is mounted on the wall, framed by a dark wooden border. The walls are painted a warm, golden yellow, creating a cozy atmosphere. A framed botanical print hangs on the wall to the left of the television.
