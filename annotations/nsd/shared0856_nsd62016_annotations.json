The walls are painted a soft, muted yellow-beige, creating a cozy backdrop. The focal point is a large, curved kitchen island crafted from a light-colored stone, likely quartz or granite, which dominates the center of the room. The island features a sleek, stainless steel sink and a waterfall edge.  Adjacent to the island are rich, dark reddish-brown wooden cabinets, providing a strong contrast. A stainless steel refrigerator and a stainless steel range hood are integrated into the cabinetry. \n\nOverhead, several pendant lights with warm, orange-toned shades hang down, casting a gentle glow. The floor is a warm, reddish-brown hardwood. Three comfortable, woven rattan bar stools are positioned at the island. The composition is balanced, with the island acting as the central element, and the lighting contributing to a welcoming and stylish aesthetic.
