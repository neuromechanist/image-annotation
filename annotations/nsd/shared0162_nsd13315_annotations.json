Her hair is neatly tied back in a small bun, and she appears to be in a deep, restful sleep, her face relaxed and her mouth slightly open, suggesting a dreamy or contented state. A light brown blanket is draped over her, adding a warm contrast to the cool white tones of the room and the girl's nightgown. The lighting is soft and diffused, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the contours of her face and the folds of the blanket, creating a tranquil and peaceful atmosphere.
