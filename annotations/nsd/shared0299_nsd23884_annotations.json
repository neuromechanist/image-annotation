The vanity is dark brown, providing a strong contrast with the lighter tiles and fixtures. \n\nBehind the vanity is a glass-enclosed shower, with a chrome shower door and a chrome showerhead visible. A white toilet is positioned to the right of the vanity. Above the vanity, a small, round, white light fixture provides the primary illumination. The lighting is soft and diffused, casting gentle shadows. The overall composition is symmetrical, with the vanity and shower taking center stage.

Chrome faucets and a soap dispenser are visible on the countertop, reflecting the light. A large mirror extends vertically, reflecting the vanity and a portion of the tiled wall. To the right of the vanity is a white doorframe. \n\nThe background is entirely occupied by a shower stall. It features a tiled enclosure with a sliding glass and metal framed door. The tiles are a warm, earthy brown color, creating a cohesive look with the vanity's neutral tones. Inside the stall, a white shower base is visible, along with a showerhead and controls. The shower stall and vanity are spatially related as they are both within the same bathroom, suggesting a functional and compact layout. The overall aesthetic is clean and simple, with a focus on practicality and neutral color schemes.",
