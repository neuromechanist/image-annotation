A bright blue, cylindrical gel pen sits prominently in the center, its smooth, glossy surface reflecting the light. To the left of the pen are a pair of bright blue scissors, also with glossy surfaces. A small, white paper template, resembling a simple geometric shape (possibly a cube), is positioned just above the pen, suggesting a design or crafting project in progress. \n\nThe lighting is bright and even, casting soft shadows and highlighting the reflective qualities of the pen and scissors. A white Sharpie marker rests beside the pen, adding a small, contrasting detail. The composition is deliberately uncluttered, focusing attention on the pen and the tools surrounding it. The overall effect is clean, modern, and suggests a creative workspace.",

The scissors are positioned diagonally across the frame, with their blades slightly open. The Sharpie lies horizontally next to the scissors, its cap removed. To the upper right, a blue, 3D rendering of a cylinder is visible, accompanied by a handwritten label \"Gel with bend\". The lighting appears soft and diffused, creating minimal shadows and emphasizing the clean, bright aesthetic.
