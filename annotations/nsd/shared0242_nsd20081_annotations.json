Dominating the scene are two large, rolling hills, covered in a vibrant, lush green grass that stretches as far as the eye can see. The hills are dark brown and rocky at their bases, creating a strong contrast with the bright green. A small, clear stream meanders through the valley floor, reflecting the sky and adding a sense of movement to the landscape. \n\nScattered throughout the field are numerous sheep, appearing as small, white shapes against the green. The lighting is bright and even, suggesting a sunny day. The composition is balanced, with the hills framing the scene and the stream leading the viewer\u2019s eye across the landscape. The overall effect is one of tranquility and natural beauty, evoking a sense of open space and rural life.",

Within this expanse, a small, shallow stream meanders through the grass, reflecting the bright blue sky above. Scattered across the meadow are numerous white sheep, appearing almost uniformly distributed, suggesting a large flock grazing peacefully. The grass itself is dense and thick, indicating a healthy, fertile environment. \n\nMoving into the background, a dark, imposing mountain range rises dramatically, forming a solid, dark silhouette against the bright blue sky. The mountains appear rugged and textured, adding depth and scale to the scene. The mountains create a strong contrast with the open meadow and the sheep, emphasizing the vastness of the landscape.
