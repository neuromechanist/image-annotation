The platform is constructed of light-colored concrete, and a small, white bridge spans the tracks above. Tall, mature trees with dense green foliage line the background, creating a natural backdrop. \n\nThe focal point is a sleek, silver train with a striking blue front and a prominent yellow nose displaying the number \"378 218\". The train is moving forward, creating a sense of motion. Overhead power lines stretch across the scene, feeding electricity to the train. The lighting is bright and diffused, casting subtle shadows and highlighting the textures of the tracks and the train\u2019s exterior.
