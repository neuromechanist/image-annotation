The sky is a brilliant, clear blue, creating a stark contrast with the white expanse of snow. A lone ski instructor, silhouetted in a vibrant orange jacket and black pants, is pointing with one hand towards the right, seemingly giving directions to a group of three skiers. The skiers, also in orange jackets and black pants, are positioned closely together, each wearing a black backpack and sporting ski helmets. They are standing with their skis laid out on the snow, with ski poles resting beside them. \n\nThe lighting is strong and directional, casting long, sharp shadows of the skiers and the instructor across the snow. The composition is centered around the group, emphasizing their interaction and the activity of skiing. The overall impression is one of a winter sports lesson taking place under a clear, sunny sky, with a sense of movement and potential adventure.",

A male instructor, clad in a bright orange jacket and black pants, stands prominently, gesturing with his right hand as if pointing out a direction. Behind him, three other skiers \u2013 two men and one woman \u2013 are positioned, each wearing similar winter gear. They are all focused on the instructor, their skis laid out on the snow, suggesting they are pausing to receive instructions. The snow itself is pristine and undisturbed, with long, dark shadows cast by the skiers, creating a stark contrast against the bright white surface. \n\nThe background reveals a vast, snow-covered mountain range. The mountains are a muted gray-blue, blending seamlessly into the sky, creating a sense of immense scale and isolation. The mountains rise dramatically in the distance, emphasizing the skiers\u2019 smallness within this expansive, wintry landscape. The entire scene suggests a remote, mountainous setting, likely a ski resort, where the group is receiving guidance for their activity.",
