However, the overall tone is subtly subdued. The dark, matte black of the lunchbox and the slightly muted colors of the food create a sense of introspection.

The baguette, a classic symbol of French cuisine, adds a touch of sophistication, but it's presented in a way that feels more functional than celebratory.
