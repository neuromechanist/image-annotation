The setting is a Mediterranean sea, with a sprawling city rising in the background. The water is a deep, shimmering blue, reflecting the sky above. A range of rugged, hazy mountains forms a dramatic backdrop, their slopes tinted with shades of brown and gray. Several colorful kites, predominantly red, yellow, and white, dominate the sky, soaring high above the water. These kites are actively being used by windsurfers and kitesurfers, creating dynamic movement within the frame. \n\nThe city itself is a mix of low-rise buildings and a taller, modern skyscraper, suggesting a coastal urban area. The lighting is bright and sunny, casting a warm glow over the scene. The composition is balanced, with the kites scattered across the frame, drawing the eye towards the horizon.
