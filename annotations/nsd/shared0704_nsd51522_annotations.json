At the center, a yellow plate holds a cluster of green grapes, their glossy skin reflecting light, surrounded by a mix of red and green apples, their skin smooth and slightly textured. To the left, a bunch of bright orange carrots and a green bell pepper add a pop of color, while a bunch of ripe bananas, their yellow peels contrasting with the other elements, are neatly arranged in a wire basket. In the background, a clear glass vase filled with fresh green leaves adds a touch of nature and complements the earthy tones of the table. The lighting is soft and natural, likely from a nearby window, casting gentle shadows and enhancing the natural hues of the produce. The overall composition is simple yet rich in detail, evoking a sense of freshness and abundance, as if inviting the viewer to partake in a healthy and delicious meal.",
