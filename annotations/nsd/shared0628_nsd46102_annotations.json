In the distance, a hazy cityscape of buildings and hills rises against a pale blue sky, suggesting a harbor or bay setting. \n\nOne man wears a dark gray hooded jacket and a dark gray beanie, while the other is clad in a black jacket. Both are wearing hats \u2013 a light beige fedora and a dark gray baseball cap respectively. The lighting is soft and diffused, indicating an overcast day. The color palette is dominated by blues and grays, with the red of the bench providing a warm contrast. \n\nThe composition is balanced, with the two figures positioned symmetrically on the bench, drawing the eye towards the water.

The focus is sharp on the figures and the bench, while the background is slightly blurred, emphasizing the scene\u2019s depth.",
