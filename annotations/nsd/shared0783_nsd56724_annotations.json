The monitor, which appears to be a CRT model, is angled slightly towards the viewer, suggesting a comfortable viewing position. Below the monitor, a black ergonomic keyboard with a curved wrist rest is placed, its keys reflecting a metallic sheen. Adjacent to the keyboard, a matching black wireless mouse rests on the desk, its glossy surface catching the light. The desk itself has a smooth finish, with a subtle grain visible under the lighting. The background is a plain off-white wall, which provides a neutral backdrop that accentuates the dark tones of the computer equipment. The lighting in the room is soft and diffused, likely from an overhead source, casting gentle shadows and creating a calm, focused atmosphere. The overall composition is clean and functional, with a focus on the essential elements of a computer workstation.",

Beside the keyboard sits a matching black computer mouse. A large, black monitor occupies the majority of the frame, angled slightly upwards. It's a flat-screen monitor with a dark bezel. \n\nThe lighting is soft and diffused, likely from an unseen window, casting subtle shadows around the monitor and keyboard. The overall composition is straightforward, with the monitor and keyboard positioned centrally. A white, sheer curtain is visible in the background, adding a touch of texture and softness. The scene conveys a sense of functionality and practicality, suggesting a workspace geared towards productivity.
