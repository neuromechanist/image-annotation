The walls are adorned with small, beige tiles, creating a neutral backdrop that contrasts with the dark wooden frame of the mirror above the sink. The sink itself is a simple, white porcelain basin with a single faucet, positioned directly below the mirror. A small bottle of orange liquid soap sits on the edge of the sink, adding a pop of color to the otherwise muted palette. To the left of the sink, a paper towel dispenser and a neatly folded white towel hang on the wall, while to the right, a baby changing station with a blue and yellow bear logo is mounted on the wall. The lighting is warm and ambient, emanating from a set of three pendant lights above the mirror, casting a soft glow that enhances the clean and inviting atmosphere of the space. The overall composition is simple and functional, with each element thoughtfully placed to maximize utility and comfort.",
