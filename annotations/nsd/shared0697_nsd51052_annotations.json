The walls are covered in off-white, rectangular tiles, creating a simple and functional aesthetic. A white bathtub dominates the left side of the frame, positioned against a dark teal wall. The bathtub is equipped with a chrome-plated faucet and showerhead. To the right of the bathtub is a white toilet with a classic, pedestal design and a brown seat. The floor is tiled with a distinctive pattern of red and white squares, adding a touch of vintage charm. \n\nThe lighting appears to be soft and diffused, likely from an overhead light source, as there are no harsh shadows. The overall composition is straightforward, focusing on the essential elements of a bathroom. The space feels compact and slightly worn, suggesting a building with some age. The color palette is primarily neutral \u2013 white, teal, red, and brown \u2013 creating a calm, if somewhat unremarkable, atmosphere.",

The bathtub is partially enclosed by white tiled walls, creating a shower area. The floor is covered in a checkered pattern of white, red, and dark green tiles.
