A bright red, double-decker tour bus dominates the foreground, slowly moving along the road, presumably carrying tourists. Several cars, a red sports car and a blue sedan, are positioned along the street, suggesting typical city traffic. A cyclist is visible further down the avenue, navigating the road alongside the bus. Along the sides of the road, a line of tall, leafy trees creates a green border, punctuated by decorative flags waving gently in the breeze. Two individuals are visible in the distance, one pushing a cleaning cart and another standing near a stone wall. The scene conveys a sense of movement and activity, with the bus being the focal point, interacting with the traffic and the surrounding environment. The flags add a festive touch, reinforcing the tourist-friendly atmosphere of the location.",
