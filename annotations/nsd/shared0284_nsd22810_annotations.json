The tower is constructed of rough-hewn, golden-brown sandstone, displaying a textured surface with varying shades and irregularities, indicative of its age and weathering. The stonework is dominated by a large, arched opening, likely a doorway or window, situated roughly halfway up the tower. Above this opening, a circular clock face with a pale blue hand is prominently displayed, adding a touch of classic design. \n\nThe lighting is strong and directional, casting a distinct shadow from the tower onto the ground, emphasizing its height and solidity. The overall composition is vertically oriented, drawing the eye upwards and creating a sense of grandeur. The stark contrast between the warm tones of the stone and the cool blue of the sky creates a visually striking image, suggesting a timeless and imposing architectural structure. The scene evokes a sense of history and stability.",
