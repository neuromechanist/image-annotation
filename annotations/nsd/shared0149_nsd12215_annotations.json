Eight red and white jets are arranged in a tight, linear formation, soaring through the air with trails of white exhaust billowing dramatically behind them. The jets are predominantly red with white markings, creating a striking contrast against the blue backdrop. The white contrails stretch out behind each aircraft, forming long, curved lines that suggest speed and movement. \n\nThe lighting is bright and sunny, casting a warm glow on the scene and highlighting the intensity of the white trails. The composition is balanced, with the formation of jets dominating the central area of the frame. The sky is clear and cloudless, emphasizing the precision and scale of the aerial display. The overall effect is one of power, precision, and spectacle, showcasing the impressive skill of the pilots and the beauty of the aerobatic performance.",
