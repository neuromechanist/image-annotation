A large, comfortable, brown and white patterned sofa sits against one wall, topped with a red throw pillow. Adjacent to it is a striking red armchair. \n\nA dark wood dining table is surrounded by six chairs, and a glass-topped coffee table sits in the center. Above the table hangs a small, abstract artwork featuring a tree. A distressed, multi-colored wooden cabinet stands against the far wall, showcasing a mix of red, green, and brown hues. Natural light streams in through a dark green sliding glass door on the right, partially obscured by a dark shade. A ceiling fan with a light fixture is centrally located.
