The stripes are particularly pronounced on its head and neck, which are bent downwards as it feeds on the foliage. The background is a blurred expanse of dark green vegetation, suggesting a dense, natural habitat, possibly a savanna or woodland. \n\nThe lighting appears to be soft and diffused, creating gentle highlights and shadows on the zebra\u2019s coat and the surrounding plants. The composition is somewhat tight, focusing on the zebra's head and upper body, which draws the viewer's attention to its unique pattern and gentle expression.

The background is much darker and more indistinct, consisting of shadowy trees and dense vegetation. This creates a strong contrast with the brightly striped zebra, making it the clear focal point.
