The setting appears to be a rural area, likely a cross-country course for equestrian events, given the undulating terrain. The horse is a magnificent dark bay, powerfully built with a flowing black mane and tail, and is wearing white and black riding boots and leg wraps. The rider, clad in a white and black technical vest with the number 64 prominently displayed, is expertly positioned in the saddle, maintaining a balanced posture as he guides the horse forward. \n\nThe dominant color is green, reflecting the vibrant grass of the hillside, contrasted by the dark horse and rider. Sunlight illuminates the scene, casting subtle shadows and highlighting the muscular form of the horse. The composition is well-balanced, with the horse and rider positioned slightly off-center, creating a sense of movement and energy.
