The stop sign is a classic red octagon with white lettering, while the one-way sign is black with a white arrow pointing to the right. The street is covered in a thick layer of snow, with tire tracks visible, suggesting recent activity. The background features a brick building with lit windows, adding to the warm ambiance. Bare, dark trees line the street, their branches reaching into the night sky, which is a mix of dark clouds and a faint, pale blue hue. The overall composition is balanced, with the signs in the foreground leading the eye towards the building in the background, creating a sense of depth and perspective. The lighting, primarily from the streetlights, casts long shadows and gives the scene a quiet, almost melancholic atmosphere.",
