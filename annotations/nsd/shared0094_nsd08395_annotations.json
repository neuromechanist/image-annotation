The oven\u2019s exterior is constructed of dark, weathered brick, with a substantial stainless steel door and control panel dominating the frame. Inside, a perfectly formed, golden-brown pizza sits on a dark, rectangular baking stone. The pizza is generously topped with vibrant red tomato sauce, melted mozzarella cheese, and scattered fresh basil leaves. \n\nThe interior of the oven is dominated by intense, radiating heat, creating a brilliant orange-red glow that fills the entire space. The heat reflects off the stainless steel surfaces, intensifying the light. The brick walls are darkened by the heat, contributing to the dramatic effect. The control panel displays a temperature reading. The composition is tightly framed, focusing entirely on the pizza and the intense heat within the oven, emphasizing the process of baking. The overall impression is one of intense heat, deliciousness, and the artistry of traditional pizza making.",
