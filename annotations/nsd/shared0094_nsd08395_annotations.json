The oven\u2019s exterior is constructed of dark, weathered brick, with a substantial stainless steel door and control panel dominating the frame. Inside, a perfectly formed, golden-brown pizza sits on a dark, rectangular baking stone. The pizza is generously topped with vibrant red tomato sauce, melted mozzarella cheese, and scattered fresh basil leaves. \n\nThe interior of the oven is dominated by intense, radiating heat, creating a brilliant orange-red glow that fills the entire space. The heat reflects off the stainless steel surfaces, intensifying the light. The brick walls are darkened by the heat, contributing to the dramatic effect. The control panel displays a temperature reading. The composition is tightly framed, focusing entirely on the pizza and the intense heat within the oven, emphasizing the process of baking. The overall impression is one of intense heat, deliciousness, and the artistry of traditional pizza making.",

A partially cooked pizza rests on a long, metal peel inside the oven, positioned towards the center. The lighting is dramatic, with the intense heat of the oven creating a bright, warm glow that contrasts sharply with the dark surroundings. The stainless steel frame of the oven reflects some of this light, adding to the overall brightness. A digital display on the lower right indicates a temperature of 866\u00b0F. The composition is centered on the oven's interior, drawing the viewer's eye to the pizza and the fiery brickwork. The dark brick archway frames the scene, creating a sense of depth and highlighting the oven as the focal point. The overall impression is one of warmth, craftsmanship, and the promise of a delicious, wood-fired pizza.",
