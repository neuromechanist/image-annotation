The oven\u2019s exterior is constructed of dark, weathered brick, with a substantial stainless steel door and controls. Inside, a perfectly formed, circular pizza sits on a dark, stone-like surface. The pizza is topped with vibrant red sauce, melted mozzarella cheese, and scattered fresh basil leaves, creating a striking contrast against the dark base. \n\nThe interior of the oven is dominated by intense, radiating heat, casting a brilliant orange-red glow throughout the entire scene. This heat is reflected off the stainless steel door and the brick walls, intensifying the color. The lighting is entirely self-generated by the oven's flames, creating a dramatic and almost surreal effect. The composition is focused tightly on the pizza, emphasizing its shape and the textures of the ingredients. The overall impression is one of intense heat, culinary artistry, and a rustic, inviting atmosphere.",
