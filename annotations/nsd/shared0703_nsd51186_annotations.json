The focal point is a dark brown, arched bed frame with a white, patterned duvet cover. The duvet features a subtle, floral design in muted beige and cream tones, creating a warm and inviting feel.  Pillows in a vibrant green are neatly arranged on the bed, adding a pop of color. A black desk chair sits beside the bed, suggesting a workspace. The floor is covered in warm-toned hardwood planks, reflecting the light. \n\nA tall, black lamp stands on the desk, casting a warm glow. Natural light streams in through a large window, illuminating the room and creating bright highlights on the hardwood floor. The window reveals a glimpse of lush greenery outside, hinting at a garden or trees. The overall composition is calm and serene, with a sense of order and comfort. The lighting and color palette contribute to a peaceful and inviting atmosphere.",
