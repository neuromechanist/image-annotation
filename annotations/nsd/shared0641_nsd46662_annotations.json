The setting is a pebbly beach, covered in a mix of grey and white stones, with a calm, turquoise sea stretching out into the distance. Several small fishing boats, predominantly white and red, are clustered together, occupying the foreground and midground. Each boat is equipped with a small outboard motor and a blue tarpaulin covering the deck. Brightly colored life preservers \u2013 red, white, and blue \u2013 bob alongside the vessels. \n\nThe lighting is bright and sunny, casting a warm glow on the boats and the surrounding area. The color palette is dominated by blues and whites of the sea and boats, contrasted with the earthy tones of the pebbles. The composition is layered, with the boats creating a sense of depth and activity. The overall impression is one of a lively, working harbor, suggesting a traditional fishing community.",

Several boats are painted in various colors \u2013 red, white, blue, and dark grey \u2013 each with a distinctive character. Each boat is equipped with a small outboard motor, a blue tarpaulin covering the deck, and a bright pink buoy bobbing gently in the water.

The shoreline is visible in the distance, a strip of pale sand and rocky cliffs. The boats are positioned close to the water's edge, emphasizing their connection to the sea. The overall impression is one of a working harbor, with the boats as the central focus, blending seamlessly into the natural coastal setting.
