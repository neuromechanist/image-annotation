Several boats are clustered together, their hulls painted in a variety of colors \u2013 red, white, blue, and black \u2013 creating a vibrant, somewhat chaotic composition. A person in a green shirt is standing near a red boat, seemingly inspecting or preparing it. Several life preservers, marked with red and white stripes, are visible on the boats, indicating safety precautions. A blue tarpaulin covers one of the boats, likely to protect it from the elements. A couple of outboard motors are also present, suggesting the boats are ready for use. The boats are positioned on a beach covered in small, rounded pebbles, which slope gently down to the turquoise water. The overall impression is one of a working harbor, with the boats representing the livelihood of the people who depend on the sea.",
