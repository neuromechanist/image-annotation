A dark brown wooden coffee table sits in front of the sofa, holding a glass vase filled with white flowers, a stack of magazines, and a small ceramic bowl. To the side, a small, round wooden side table holds a lamp with a warm-toned bulb, a collection of framed photographs, and a decorative ceramic figure. \n\nThe floor is covered in a patterned rug with a floral design in shades of brown and cream. A large window is visible in the background, casting a soft, warm light into the room. The overall composition is inviting and suggests a lived-in space.

A rustic wooden coffee table, laden with a vase of white flowers, a stack of magazines, and a small bowl, sits centrally, anchoring the arrangement.
