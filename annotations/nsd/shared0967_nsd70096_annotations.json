The sand is a pale beige color, speckled with dark seaweed and debris. \n\nA young man, wearing a red and black \u201cONDA\u201d wetsuit, is carrying a surfboard under his arm.

The setting is a sandy shoreline meeting a turquoise ocean, with gentle waves lapping at the sand. The main element is a man fully clad in a maroon wetsuit, carrying a white and teal surfboard under his arm. The wetsuit features the word \"ONDA\" prominently displayed on the chest. The color palette is dominated by the blues and greens of the ocean, contrasted with the maroon of the wetsuit and the sandy beige of the beach. \n\nThe lighting appears to be bright and natural, suggesting a sunny day, with some areas of shadow on the surfer's body. The composition is a medium shot, focusing on the surfer as he walks towards the right of the frame. The background is slightly blurred, emphasizing the subject. There's a scattering of seaweed and debris on the sand in the foreground, adding texture and a sense of realism to the scene. The overall impression is one of relaxed athleticism and coastal life.",
