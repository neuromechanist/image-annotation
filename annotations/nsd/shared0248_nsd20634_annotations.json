One container holds a vibrant mix of green broccoli and dark, glistening seaweed salad, alongside a small portion of orange-colored stir-fry. Another container is filled with sliced red apples, neatly arranged. The third container displays sushi rolls wrapped in nori seaweed, interspersed with bright red cherry tomatoes. These containers are placed side-by-side on a textured white surface, likely a tablecloth or placemat. The arrangement suggests a prepared meal, intended for individual consumption. The components are separated within their containers, but collectively form a balanced and colorful lunch. The items don't interact with each other directly, but their proximity implies they are part of the same meal, designed to be enjoyed together. The overall impression is one of healthy eating and careful food preparation.",
