A polished, light-colored marble countertop dominates the foreground, upon which three glasses of wine are arranged. Two glasses, one clear and one frosted, hold amber-colored wines, likely a sherry or port. The third glass contains a deep, ruby-red Chardonay wine. A bottle of the Chardonay is prominently displayed, its red label reading \"Wayne Gretzky's\" and \"Fine Chardonay\". The bottle is tall and slender, with a red foil-covered cap. \n\nThe background is a dark, matte black wall, providing a stark contrast to the lighter elements. A blurred figure of a man in a black shirt is visible in the background, suggesting a bar or restaurant setting. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating subtle reflections on the marble and glass. The overall composition is carefully arranged, emphasizing the textures and colors of the wine and glassware. The image has a sophisticated and slightly upscale feel.",
