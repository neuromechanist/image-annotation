The riverbanks are lined with dense, verdant vegetation, including trees and bushes, which add depth and texture to the scene. The lighting is natural and bright, suggesting a sunny day, with soft shadows cast by the trees and the punt, enhancing the three-dimensional quality of the image. The overall composition is balanced, with the punt and its occupants positioned slightly off-center, drawing the viewer's eye down the length of the river. The stone wall and brick structures on the right side of the image add an element of architectural interest and suggest a historical or urban setting, contrasting with the natural beauty of the river and its banks.

The background is dominated by dense, verdant trees and bushes lining the canal, creating a natural border that frames the canal and the boat.

Further back, the canal walls are constructed of aged stone, with visible signs of weathering and moss growth, adding a historical and rustic charm to the scene.
