Two individuals are seated on the snow, one wearing a yellow jacket and the other in a black and white jacket, both equipped with snowboarding gear. The person in the yellow jacket is seated with their legs crossed, while the one in black is sitting with their legs extended, both appearing relaxed and possibly engaged in a conversation or simply enjoying the moment. The snowboard is positioned between them, suggesting they might have been snowboarding before taking a break. The background is a vast expanse of untouched snow, with faint tracks indicating previous activity. The overall color palette is dominated by cool tones of blue and white, with the yellow jacket providing a vibrant contrast. The composition is simple yet evocative, focusing on the two figures and their immediate surroundings, creating a sense of tranquility and leisure in a snowy environment.",
