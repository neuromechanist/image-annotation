The setting is a wide, open ocean with a vibrant turquoise and emerald green sea stretching towards the horizon. Large, rolling waves, capped with frothy white crests, surge towards the shore, creating a sense of movement and power. The surfer, clad in a dark wetsuit, is positioned in the middle of a breaking wave, skillfully maneuvering his surfboard. His body is angled slightly, suggesting he\u2019s leaning into the wave. \n\nThe lighting is bright and diffused, likely from an overcast sky, which softens the colors and eliminates harsh shadows. The overall composition is balanced, with the surfer acting as the central focal point, drawing the eye across the expansive ocean. The colors are rich and saturated, emphasizing the beauty and energy of the sea. The image evokes a feeling of freedom, adventure, and the thrill of riding the waves.",

The setting is a coastal environment with a vast expanse of turquoise and teal water dominating the frame. Waves are rolling in, creating white foam crests as they break. A lone surfer, appearing as a dark silhouette, is positioned on a wave, seemingly mid-ride. The color palette is primarily cool, with varying shades of blue and green in the water, contrasted by the white foam. The sky is a muted blue with some cloud cover, suggesting a slightly overcast day. The lighting is relatively soft, creating a natural and somewhat subdued atmosphere.
