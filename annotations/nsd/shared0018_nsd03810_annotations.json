A herd of approximately eight brown cattle dominates the foreground, moving steadily across a grassy field. The cattle are a rich, earthy brown, with varying shades and textures, and they appear to be grazing, with some heads lowered. The ground is a dry, sun-baked tan color, speckled with small rocks and patches of sparse vegetation. Behind the cattle rises a dense, imposing green mountain, its slopes covered in a thick coniferous forest, providing a strong vertical element to the composition. \n\nThe sky is a brilliant blue, filled with fluffy, white cumulus clouds that cast soft shadows across the landscape. The lighting is bright and even, suggesting a clear, warm day. The overall composition is balanced, with the cattle acting as a central focal point, drawing the viewer's eye towards the distant mountain. The scene evokes a sense of tranquility and rural beauty, highlighting the harmony between livestock and nature.",

Structure the output with these exact three levels:\nLevel 1 (Categories): Use only these four keys: 'human', 'animal', 'man-made', 'natural'\nLevel 2 (Item names): Specific names of detected items (e.g., 'person', 'dog', 'car', 'tree')\nLevel 3 (Attributes): Use ONLY these keys for each item:\n  \u2022 count: number of instances (integer)\n  \u2022 location: position in image (use terms like: left/center/right, top/middle/bottom, foreground/background)\n  \u2022 color: main color(s) if applicable (array of strings)\n  \u2022 size: relative size (small/medium/large)\n  \u2022 description: any other relevant details that don't fit above categories (string)\nOutput valid JSON only. Include only categories that contain detected items. If an attribute doesn't apply to an item (e.g., color for sky), omit that key rather than using null. The 'description' field should capture important characteristics like actions, states, or specific features not covered by other keys.",
