They are all wearing ski helmets and goggles. The lighting is primarily artificial, emanating from the resort\u2019s buildings and signage, creating a cool, bright atmosphere.

The individuals are dressed in colorful winter attire, including jackets, gloves, and ski goggles, suggesting they are prepared for skiing or snowboarding. The colors of their outfits vary, with prominent shades of brown, gray, blue, and black, adding vibrancy to the otherwise monochrome snowy landscape. One person in the center is wearing a headband with Olympic rings, indicating a possible connection to the Olympic Games or winter sports events. The group appears cheerful and close-knit, with some members placing their arms around each other, creating a sense of camaraderie.
