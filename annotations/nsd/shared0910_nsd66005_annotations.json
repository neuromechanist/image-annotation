The primary subject is a striking zebra, captured from a side view, emphasizing its distinctive markings. The zebra is predominantly white with bold, black stripes that run vertically across its body, creating a dynamic pattern. Its legs are a pale grey, and its mane is a lighter shade of grey. The zebra\u2019s tail is particularly voluminous, displaying a large, bushy tuft of dark grey hair, almost black, that dominates the lower right of the frame. \n\nThe background consists of lush green grass and scattered vegetation, suggesting a warm, sunny environment. The lighting is soft and diffused, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the zebra\u2019s texture. The composition is balanced, with the zebra positioned slightly off-center, drawing the eye across its body. The overall impression is one of wild beauty and the raw elegance of this iconic African animal.",
