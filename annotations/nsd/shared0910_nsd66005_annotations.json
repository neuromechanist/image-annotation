The primary subject is a striking zebra, captured from a side view, emphasizing its distinctive markings. The zebra is predominantly white with bold, black stripes that run vertically across its body, creating a dynamic pattern. Its legs are a pale grey, and its mane is a lighter shade of grey. The zebra\u2019s tail is particularly voluminous, displaying a large, bushy tuft of dark grey hair, almost black, that dominates the lower right of the frame. \n\nThe background consists of lush green grass and scattered vegetation, suggesting a warm, sunny environment. The lighting is soft and diffused, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the zebra\u2019s texture. The composition is balanced, with the zebra positioned slightly off-center, drawing the eye across its body. The overall impression is one of wild beauty and the raw elegance of this iconic African animal.",

The zebra is the clear focal point, positioned slightly off-center, facing towards the left of the frame. Its distinctive black and white stripes cover its entire body, creating a striking pattern. The stripes are particularly pronounced around its hindquarters and along its legs. The setting appears to be a woodland or savanna environment, with lush green grass covering the ground and blurred trees visible in the background. The lighting seems to be soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast day or a shaded area. This creates gentle highlights and shadows on the zebra's coat, emphasizing its form and texture. The overall composition is well-balanced, with the zebra filling a significant portion of the frame, yet still allowing for a sense of its natural habitat.
