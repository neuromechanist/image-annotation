A young girl, wearing a black hooded jacket and riding boots, is confidently seated atop a beautiful, fluffy white pony. The pony is a relatively small breed, likely a Shetland or similar, with a thick, wavy mane and tail that creates a halo effect around its head. A white bridle and reins complete the equestrian ensemble. The pony is positioned on a dark, gravelly surface, likely a riding arena or paddock, surrounded by a dense, bare deciduous forest. \n\nThe dominant colors are muted \u2013 the stark white of the pony contrasts with the dark ground and the grey-brown tones of the trees. The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast day, casting gentle shadows. The composition is centered, with the pony taking up the majority of the frame, emphasizing its presence. The overall feeling is one of quietness and connection between the girl and her equine companion, highlighting a classic equestrian scene.",
