The bed is a traditional style with horizontal slats running across its width and a gently curved headboard adorned with small, decorative floral carvings. A crisp, white cotton sheet is pulled taut over the mattress, creating a clean and inviting appearance. The bed sits on a light beige carpet, which extends into the frame's lower portion. \n\nThe wall is a muted beige color, providing a neutral backdrop. The lighting appears to be soft and diffused, casting subtle shadows and highlighting the textures of the wood and fabric. In the lower right corner, a brightly patterned suitcase sits partially visible, adding a touch of color and suggesting a recent travel experience. The overall composition is straightforward and calm, emphasizing the bed as the central focus of the image. The scene evokes a sense of quiet rest and simplicity.",

Include only categories that contain detected items. If an attribute doesn't apply to an item (e.g., color for sky), omit that key rather than using null. The 'description' field should capture important characteristics like actions, states, or specific features not covered by other keys.",
