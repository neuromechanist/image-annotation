The other donut is a classic chocolate donut, completely covered in a glossy, dark chocolate glaze and liberally studded with crushed Oreo cookies. \n\nThe lighting is soft and diffused, creating gentle highlights on the glazed surfaces and sprinkles. The overall composition is simple and inviting, emphasizing the colorful treats. The donuts are positioned slightly off-center, drawing the viewer's eye.
