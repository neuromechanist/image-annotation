The walls are a light beige, providing a calming backdrop to the kitchen\u2019s features. The cabinetry is a rich, medium-brown wood finish, likely maple or oak, with a smooth, matte sheen. The countertops are a speckled granite with shades of gray, beige, and white, adding a touch of luxury. \n\nA black, standard-sized range hood sits above a black range, which is the focal point of the scene. Adjacent to the range is a lower cabinet with a matching countertop. The floor is covered in beige tile, creating a consistent and easy-to-clean surface. There are two electrical outlets visible on the wall. The lighting appears to be bright and even, suggesting either natural light or well-placed artificial lighting.
