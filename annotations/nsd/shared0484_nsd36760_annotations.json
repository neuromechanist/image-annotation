The poles the skier holds are used for propulsion and balance, demonstrating the interaction between the skier and their equipment. The overall scene conveys a sense of solitude, connection with nature, and the peaceful enjoyment of winter sports. The relationship between the skier and the environment is harmonious, with the skier appreciating the natural beauty and engaging in an activity that complements the winter landscape.",
