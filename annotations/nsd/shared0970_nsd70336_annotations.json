The ground is a light brown earth tone. Behind the giraffes, a dense collection of leafy green trees and shrubs creates a lush backdrop, partially obscuring the horizon. \n\nOne giraffe, predominantly white with distinctive black and brown markings, stands tall and alert, its neck extended upwards towards the foliage. Beside it, a darker giraffe, with a predominantly black coat and white markings, is partially obscured, seemingly leaning against the taller giraffe. The lighting is bright and natural, casting shadows beneath the trees and highlighting the intricate patterns of the giraffes\u2019 coats.
