The primary focus is a white Apple MacBook Pro, positioned on a dark, polished wooden desk. The laptop\u2019s screen displays a dramatic, dark gray, stormy sky with jagged streaks of lightning illuminating the clouds. The lighting is predominantly cool and subdued, reflecting the stormy weather on the screen. \n\nBeside the laptop sits a white Apple mouse, and to the right, a gray Everything Mac box rests open, revealing the product. The desk surface is a rich, dark brown, providing a strong contrast to the cool tones of the laptop and screen. The composition is centered, with the laptop taking up a significant portion of the frame. The overall effect is calm and sophisticated, suggesting a creative or productive environment. The dark background and stormy sky create a sense of depth and drama, while the clean lines of the laptop and mouse contribute to a modern aesthetic.",
