The walls are a rich, muted brown, creating a cozy and intimate atmosphere. A large, four-poster bed dominates the frame, covered in crisp, white bedding \u2013 a duvet, pillows, and a ruffled bedspread. The bedspread is a vibrant, reddish-brown with a complex floral pattern. A silver tray sits atop the bed, holding a champagne bucket, suggesting a celebratory or luxurious setting. \n\nOn either side of the bed are dark wooden bedside tables, each holding a small, table lamp with a warm, yellow glow. A framed photograph hangs on the wall above the bed, depicting a vast, open landscape, likely a desert or mountainous region. The curtains are a deep burgundy with a subtle floral pattern, adding to the rich color palette.
