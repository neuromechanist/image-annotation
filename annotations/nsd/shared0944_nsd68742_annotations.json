Gentle waves break along the shore, and a few distant figures appear to be enjoying the beach. The ocean transitions from a lighter turquoise near the shore to a darker, deeper blue further out. \n\nIn the background, the coastline continues with rocky outcrops and a distant town or settlement visible on the horizon. Above it all, a clear, bright blue sky provides a vast backdrop, and a single bird soars high above, adding a sense of freedom and scale to the scene.
