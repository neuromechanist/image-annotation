The cows appear relaxed and at ease, adding a sense of tranquility to the scene. The background features a series of gently sloping hills covered in a mix of greenery and patches of darker, possibly forested areas, leading to a clear, pale blue sky that stretches across the horizon, suggesting a bright, sunny day. The lighting is natural and bright, casting soft shadows and highlighting the textures of the grass and the cows' fur, enhancing the vividness of the colors.
