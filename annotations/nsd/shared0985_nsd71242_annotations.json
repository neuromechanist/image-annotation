The walls are painted a muted beige, creating a neutral backdrop. The floor is covered in a checkered pattern of red and white tiles, reflecting the light and adding a slightly institutional feel. A dark gray vending machine dominates the left side of the frame, displaying rows of beverages and snacks. Above it, three white microwave ovens are stacked vertically, suggesting a communal space for heating food. \n\nA light gray cabinet runs along the right side, providing storage. A white pitcher sits on the countertop. The lighting is fluorescent, casting a cool, even glow across the scene. The composition is straightforward, focusing on the functional elements of the room. The overall impression is one of practicality and efficiency, typical of a workspace designed for brief breaks and quick meals.",

Immediately behind the vending machine, a gray cabinet stretches across the wall, housing three white microwave ovens stacked vertically.
