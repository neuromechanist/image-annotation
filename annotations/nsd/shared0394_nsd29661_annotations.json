The floor is covered in dark gray tiles, providing a grounding element to the space. \n\nA stainless steel sink and faucet are integrated into the countertop, and a built-in oven is visible on the left side. Above the island, a striking wood-paneled wall adds warmth and texture.  The lighting appears to be a combination of natural light from the window and recessed ceiling lights.
