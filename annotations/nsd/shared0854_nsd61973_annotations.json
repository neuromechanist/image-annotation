The donuts are perfectly round with a classic ring shape, coated in a thick, glossy glaze that reflects the light, creating a wet, inviting appearance. The glaze is a rich amber color, speckled with tiny bubbles, suggesting a light and airy texture. The donuts are positioned slightly off-center, with one leaning towards the viewer and the others positioned to the side. \n\nA delicate streak of glaze drips down the side of the plate, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The background is a clean, bright white, emphasizing the donuts and their textures. The lighting is soft and diffused, highlighting the sheen of the glaze and creating subtle shadows that define the donuts' form.
