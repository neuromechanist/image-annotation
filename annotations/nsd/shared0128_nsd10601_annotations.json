The walls are painted a soft beige, providing a neutral backdrop for the dark wood cabinetry. The cabinets are a rich, dark brown, likely a cherry or walnut finish, and feature a traditional, slightly raised-panel design. A large, black, stainless steel range dominates the left side of the kitchen, with a built-in microwave above it. To the right, a black stainless steel dishwasher sits adjacent to a sleek, white sink and countertop. The countertop itself is a speckled granite with gray and white veining. The floor is tiled with a beige and brown pattern. \n\nOverhead, a recessed light fixture provides bright, even illumination. A window, partially visible above the sink, allows natural light to enter the space. The overall composition is clean and organized, suggesting a functional and comfortable kitchen. The lighting is bright and diffused, contributing to a sense of spaciousness.",

The cabinets are arranged in a standard L-shaped kitchen layout, with a black range hood above a black range, and a black refrigerator positioned to the right. A white granite countertop extends across the work surface, supporting a stainless steel sink with a chrome faucet. The floor is tiled with a beige and brown pattern, and a floor vent is visible in the lower left corner. \n\nThe background reveals a simple, neutral-colored wall painted a light beige.
