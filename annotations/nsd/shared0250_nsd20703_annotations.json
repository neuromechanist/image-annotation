The court itself is a vibrant, almost neon green, marked with crisp white lines indicating the playing boundaries. A black net stretches across the center, separating the two sides. A young woman, wearing a white tank top and pink shorts, stands poised in the center of the court, holding a tennis racket. She is looking towards the right side of the frame. \n\nThe background is dominated by tall, mature palm trees, their fronds casting dappled shadows across the court. Several lampposts are positioned around the perimeter, providing illumination. A thatched-roof pavilion sits to the right, offering shade. The sky is a clear, bright blue, suggesting a sunny day. The lighting is bright and even, creating a sense of warmth and tranquility. The overall composition is balanced, with the woman as the central focal point, and the surrounding elements contributing to a relaxed, recreational atmosphere.",
