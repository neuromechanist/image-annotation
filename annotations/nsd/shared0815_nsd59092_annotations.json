The boat, predominantly dark blue with white and silver accents, is sleek and modern, featuring multiple windows and a robust design indicative of its law enforcement purpose. The hull is a dark navy blue, contrasting sharply with the lighter blue of the water and the white lettering on the side. The boat's wake is visible, indicating its swift movement through the water. The horizon is flat, with a faint line of land or another boat barely discernible in the distance, suggesting a vast and open setting. The lighting is diffuse, typical of an overcast day, casting a soft, even light across the scene without harsh shadows, which enhances the reflective quality of the water and the metallic surfaces of the boat.

The boat, prominently labeled \"CHICAGO POLICE\" in bold lettering along its hull, is a gray and blue patrol boat with a robust design, featuring a raised cabin and multiple handrails. The hull is a light gray, accented by a dark blue stripe running along the waterline. \"M4\" is displayed in large numerals on the bow. The boat is creating a noticeable wake, indicating it's traveling at a moderate speed. In the background, a hazy shoreline and a distant ship are visible, adding depth to the scene. The lighting appears soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast day, with the colors appearing somewhat muted.
