The path itself is a light-colored, sandy dirt, illuminated by a strong, directional sunlight that casts a warm, golden glow on the right side of the image. \n\nTwo riders are positioned centrally, one on a dark brown horse and the other on a strikingly white horse. Both riders are wearing dark helmets and riding jackets, suggesting a formal or equestrian activity. The horses are in motion, with their heads and necks extended, adding a sense of movement to the scene.
