Both are mounted on horses \u2013 a chestnut brown horse on the left and a pristine white horse on the right. The horses are in a relaxed posture, with their heads lowered.

To the left, a patch of dry, golden grass adds a textural contrast to the road. \n\nThe background is a lush, dark woodland setting. Towering trees with thick, green branches create a deep, shadowed canopy, limiting the light and creating a sense of depth. The trees are so dense that they obscure the horizon, suggesting a vast, uninterrupted forest.
