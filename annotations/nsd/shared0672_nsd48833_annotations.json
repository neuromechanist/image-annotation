The pristine white snow is crisscrossed with ski tracks, indicating previous use and adding texture to the scene.

These buildings add a touch of rustic charm and provide a sense of scale.\n\nIn the background, the majestic Matterhorn mountain rises dramatically, its iconic pyramidal shape piercing the clear blue sky. The mountain's snow-covered slopes are sharply defined, creating a striking contrast with the gentler slopes in the foreground.
