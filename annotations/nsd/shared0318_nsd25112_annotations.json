The background is filled with lush greenery, including acacia trees and other shrubs, which add depth and texture to the scene. The lighting is natural and bright, suggesting it is daytime with the sun high in the sky, casting soft shadows and highlighting the elephants' features and the surrounding foliage. The overall composition is balanced, with the elephants positioned centrally, drawing the viewer's eye into the interaction and the expansive natural environment surrounding them.

The vibrant green grass beneath their feet indicates a lush, well-nourished environment, likely a savanna or grassland.\n\nIn the background, the setting shifts to a more distant, serene landscape. Tall, leafy trees and dense foliage create a natural backdrop, providing a sense of depth and context to the scene. The trees, possibly acacia or similar species, are scattered across the horizon, hinting at a typical African savanna ecosystem. The sky above is partly cloudy, adding to the overall tranquility of the setting.
