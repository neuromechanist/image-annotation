The setting is dominated by a sandy, earthen ground, partially shaded by a large, woven, beige-colored canopy stretched across the top of the enclosure. Several large, black tires are scattered around the base, suggesting a practical element of the enclosure\u2019s design. A wooden viewing platform and railing run along the perimeter, offering visitors a vantage point. \n\nThree adult elephants are the focal point, standing tall and imposing, with one partially obscured by a large, woven ball. Two zookeepers, dressed in khaki shirts and pants, are walking alongside them, engaging with the animals. The lighting is bright and natural, casting shadows from the canopy onto the ground. The overall composition is balanced, with the elephants taking up a significant portion of the frame, creating a sense of scale and emphasizing their size. The color palette is primarily earthy \u2013 browns, tans, and greens \u2013 contributing to a natural and somewhat rustic atmosphere.",

Three elephants, varying in size, are the central focus. Two appear to be walking towards the viewer, while a third stands further back. Two people, both wearing green uniforms, are accompanying the elephants, one walking alongside the lead elephant and the other slightly behind. The enclosure itself is visible, with a sandy ground surface, a shallow water pool in the foreground, and a metal railing defining the perimeter. Several large tires are scattered around the enclosure, seemingly for the elephants to interact with. A large, beige fabric structure provides shade over the area. The people appear to be caretakers, guiding the elephants through the enclosure, possibly during a routine or enrichment activity. The elephants seem calm and engaged, interacting with the environment and the people around them. The scene conveys a sense of care and a managed interaction between humans and these magnificent animals.",
