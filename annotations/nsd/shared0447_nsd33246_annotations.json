The tiles are arranged in a grid pattern, with a decorative mosaic border running horizontally just below the upper edge of the wall, adding a subtle contrast to the otherwise uniform tiling. A white, oval-shaped sink sits atop a white countertop, positioned slightly off-center to the right. The sink is equipped with a modern, chrome faucet that gleams under the light, reflecting a sense of cleanliness and modernity. A dark gray towel hangs neatly on a towel ring to the left of the sink, its muted color providing a subtle contrast to the lighter tones of the room. The lighting appears to be ambient, possibly from a window out of frame, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the textures of the tiles and the smooth surface of the sink. The overall composition is simple and functional, with a focus on the clean lines and neutral colors that create a calm and inviting atmosphere.",
