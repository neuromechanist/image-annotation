The primary subject is a woman mid-turn, actively skiing down a wide, gently sloping run. She\u2019s wearing a bright pink, striped jacket over dark brown ski pants, a black helmet with a tinted visor, and black ski gloves. Her skis are angled sharply, indicating a controlled turn, and she's holding her poles firmly. \n\nThe background is dominated by a vast expanse of pristine white snow, stretching out towards a hazy, distant horizon. Several orange and yellow safety barriers line the edge of the slope, marking the boundary of the run. The lighting is bright and diffused, suggesting a sunny day with overcast skies. The overall composition is focused on the skier, with the slope and distant horizon providing context. The image conveys a sense of movement and adventure, highlighting the thrill of downhill skiing.

          "response": "The foreground of the image prominently features a skier in action, dressed in a vibrant pink jacket, brown pants, and a black helmet with goggles. The skier is positioned centrally, actively gliding down a snow-covered slope, holding ski poles that extend outward. The skier's dynamic posture, with bent knees and a forward-leaning stance, suggests movement and control, emphasizing the sporty and adventurous nature of the scene.\n\nIn the background, the setting is a vast, open snowy landscape under a clear, pale blue sky. The snow appears smooth and groomed, indicating a well-maintained ski slope. Distant markers, likely indicating trail boundaries or ski runs, are visible as small, colorful poles scattered across the slope. The horizon is relatively flat, with no significant mountain peaks or trees in the immediate vicinity, reinforcing the sense of openness and vastness. The background elements provide context for the skier's activity, situating the action within a typical alpine skiing environment.\n\nThe relationship between the foreground and background is one of scale and focus. The skier, as the primary subject, is sharply defined and draws the viewer's attention, while the expansive background serves to emphasize the scale of the environment and the skier's interaction with it. The contrast between the bright, colorful attire of the skier and the muted tones of the snow and sky creates a visual hierarchy, making the skier stand out as the focal point against the serene, expansive backdrop. Together, these elements create a cohesive scene that captures the thrill and beauty of skiing in a pristine, snowy setting.",

Structure the output with these exact three levels:\nLevel 1 (Categories): Use only these four keys: 'human', 'animal', 'man-made', 'natural'\nLevel 2 (Item names): Specific names of detected items (e.g., 'person', 'dog', 'car', 'tree')\nLevel 3 (Attributes): Use ONLY these keys for each item:\n  \u2022 count: number of instances (integer)\n  \u2022 location: position in image (use terms like: left/center/right, top/middle/bottom, foreground/background)\n  \u2022 color: main color(s) if applicable (array of strings)\n  \u2022 size: relative size (small/medium/large)\n  \u2022 description: any other relevant details that don't fit above categories (string)\nOutput valid JSON only. Include only categories that contain detected items. If an attribute doesn't apply to an item (e.g., color for sky), omit that key rather than using null. The 'description' field should capture important characteristics like actions, states, or specific features not covered by other keys.",
