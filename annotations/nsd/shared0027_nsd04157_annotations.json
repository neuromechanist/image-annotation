The main elements include two pomegranates and a green apple, arranged on a white, slightly wrinkled tablecloth that adds a casual, homey feel to the scene. The pomegranates, with their deep red, textured skin, are positioned on the left and right, while the green apple sits in the center, creating a balanced composition. The window behind the fruits allows for a glimpse of green foliage outside, suggesting a peaceful, possibly suburban environment. The light from the window casts gentle shadows and highlights the glossy surfaces of the fruits, enhancing their natural colors and textures. In the background, partially visible, are a white ceramic container and a metallic cup, adding subtle details to the setting without detracting from the main focus on the fruits. The overall composition is simple yet inviting, evoking a sense of freshness and simplicity.",
