Its wool is thick and slightly shaggy, with a dark gray hue that contrasts sharply with the bright green grass. The sheep is bent forward, its head lowered as it diligently consumes the vegetation. \n\nThe background is a dense, leafy woodland, filled with various shades of green foliage. Several trees are visible, their branches reaching upwards, creating a natural frame. The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast day, casting gentle shadows across the grass. The overall composition is balanced, with the sheep\u2019s posture drawing the eye and creating a sense of tranquility. The scene evokes a feeling of peacefulness and the simple beauty of nature.
