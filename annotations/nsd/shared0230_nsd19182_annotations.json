Two plastic food containers, one blue and one red, are placed on a vibrant red and white checkered tablecloth. Inside the blue container sits a generous portion of stir-fried vegetables. The dominant color is green, primarily from the broccoli florets, which are interspersed with sliced green beans and sliced mushrooms. Thinly sliced carrots add a touch of orange to the mix. The vegetables appear to be lightly coated in a glossy sauce, likely soy-based. \n\nAlongside the container of vegetables is a second container filled with a dark, rich-looking meat dish, likely a beef stir-fry. The meat is a deep brown color, suggesting it has been cooked at a high heat. Each container has a white plastic spoon resting inside. The lighting is bright and even, illuminating the food and the checkered tablecloth. The composition is straightforward, focusing entirely on the two containers and their contents, creating a sense of a quick, easy meal.",
