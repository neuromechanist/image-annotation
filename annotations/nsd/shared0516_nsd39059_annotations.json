Among them, the glossy red apples and the smooth, slightly textured oranges provide a contrast in both color and form. The kiwis, with their distinctive brown, bumpy skin, are nestled at the bottom, adding a natural, earthy tone to the mix. The lighting is soft yet directional, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the natural sheen of the fruits' surfaces, suggesting a setting that could be a market stall or a home kitchen.

The potatoes, with their rough, earthy brown texture, are nestled among the oranges, adding a neutral tone to the scene. The apples, with their red and slightly greenish skins, are placed towards the right side of the box, their polished surfaces catching the light.
