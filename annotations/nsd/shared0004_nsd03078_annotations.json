Two kayaks, one orange and one red, are anchored near the shore, with their black seats and paddles adding a contrasting dark element to the scene. The composition is balanced, with the windsurfer positioned centrally, drawing the viewer's eye across the image, from the calm, reflective water in the foreground to the verdant hillside in the background.
