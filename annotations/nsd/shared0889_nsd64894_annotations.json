Above the stove, a range hood is visible, and the backsplash is a light, neutral color that complements the overall color scheme. To the right, a sink area is equipped with a modern faucet and a drying rack, with a window above it that allows natural light to flood the space. The window has a simple, clean frame and is positioned to let in ample sunlight, enhancing the brightness of the room.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a metal rolling cart with multiple shelves is visible, likely used for storage or as a movable prep area. The floor is wooden, matching the cabinets and adding to the cohesive, warm aesthetic. The lighting is a combination of natural light from the window and a pendant light fixture hanging from the ceiling, which has a simple, white design.

The cabinetry is a rich, dark wood tone, contrasting with the pale yellow walls. The countertops are a lighter wood, and the lower cabinets are painted black. The lighting is a mix of natural light streaming in from a window on the right and a single pendant light fixture above the central workspace. The composition is framed by a partial view of a doorway or wall on the left, creating a sense of entering the space.
