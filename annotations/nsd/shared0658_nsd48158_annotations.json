A partially open white door frames the scene, leading the eye into the space. Dominating the foreground is a pristine white pedestal sink, with a chrome faucet and soap dispenser. Beside it sits a matching white toilet, neatly positioned. A bathtub, also white, occupies the back wall, its glass screen reflecting the room's light. A small potted plant with green leaves is placed on the wall above the bathtub, adding a touch of nature. A folded pink towel hangs from a chrome towel rail beside the bathtub, suggesting a recently used or prepared bathing area. The walls are covered in a warm, brown tiled pattern, creating a cozy and clean aesthetic. The window, with its frosted glass, provides natural light while maintaining privacy. The overall impression is one of a well-maintained and stylish bathroom, designed for functionality and a sense of calm.",
