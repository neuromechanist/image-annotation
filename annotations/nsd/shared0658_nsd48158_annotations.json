A white, paneled door with a simple design is visible in the foreground, framing the scene. The bathroom itself is tiled with a warm, beige-toned ceramic tile, creating a soothing and neutral atmosphere. A pristine white bathtub dominates the space, positioned beneath a large, frosted glass window. The window features a delicate, textured pattern, likely designed to diffuse light. \n\nA sleek, white toilet sits on a light-colored floor, alongside a matching white pedestal sink with a chrome faucet. A white toilet roll holder is positioned next to the toilet. A pale pink towel is neatly draped over a chrome towel rack. A small, potted bamboo plant adds a touch of greenery to the room. The lighting appears to be soft and diffused, likely from the window, contributing to the calm and inviting ambiance. The overall composition is clean and organized, emphasizing the room's contemporary design.",
