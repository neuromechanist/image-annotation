Dominating the foreground is a towering giraffe, its long neck stretching upwards, seemingly reaching for foliage. Several other giraffes are scattered throughout the sandy enclosure, some browsing on vegetation, while others stand calmly observing. The ground is a light beige sand, punctuated by a rocky area with a small waterfall cascading over the rocks into a pool. The rocks are a mix of browns and greys, creating a natural, textured backdrop. \n\nThe lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast day.

A small water feature, lined with large rocks, is partially visible at the bottom left, suggesting a constructed habitat. \n\nThe background features a group of three more giraffes, slightly smaller in scale and gathered around a raised rocky area. Beyond them, a dense backdrop of lush green trees and foliage creates a naturalistic setting, though a metal fence is visible, indicating this is likely a zoo or wildlife park.
