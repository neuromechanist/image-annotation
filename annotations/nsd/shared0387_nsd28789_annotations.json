The walls are entirely covered in clean, bright white subway tiles laid in a classic brick pattern, creating a spacious and airy feel. A light wood-framed floating vanity dominates the scene, featuring a sleek, rectangular sink with a brushed nickel faucet and a matte white countertop. Below the vanity sits a small, patterned teal rug with a geometric design. To the right of the vanity is a closed toilet with a white seat and lid. \n\nA simple, rustic wooden shelf hangs above the vanity, holding a folded blue towel and two small, turquoise bottles. The lighting is provided by a single, round, white light fixture mounted above the mirror, casting a soft glow. The overall composition is clean and uncluttered, emphasizing the bright white tiles and the modern vanity. The color palette is primarily white, teal, and wood tones, creating a calm and inviting atmosphere.",

A sleek, floating vanity with a rectangular sink takes center stage, its warm wood-toned finish contrasting with the cool tiles. A neatly folded blue towel hangs from the vanity, adding a pop of color. Above the vanity, a wooden shelf holds two small, turquoise-colored containers, suggesting personal care items. A roll of toilet paper sits on the vanity\u2019s edge. To the right, a toilet is visible, positioned on a dark floor with a patterned blue rug beneath it. A wooden door frame partially obscures the left side of the image, hinting at the space beyond. The scene conveys a sense of clean, minimalist design, with the various elements arranged to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing bathroom space.

The mirror is mounted above a light wood vanity with a white countertop, which holds a few neatly arranged toiletries in blue and white containers, adding a pop of color. A small, patterned blue and white bath mat lies on the dark, textured floor, contrasting subtly with the white tiles. The vanity has a simple design with a single sink and a single faucet, and a small green towel hangs neatly on the side. The overall composition is simple and functional, with a focus on practicality and a touch of color to break the monotony of the white and wood tones.
