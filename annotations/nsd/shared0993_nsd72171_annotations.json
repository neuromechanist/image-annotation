The dominant element is a gray asphalt surface, marked with thick, white painted lines that delineate parking spaces. Three seagulls are huddled together on the asphalt, their plumage a mix of gray and white, creating a subtle contrast against the dark surface. One seagull is perched upright, facing the camera with its head slightly tilted, while the others are nestled close together, seemingly resting. \n\nThe lighting is strong and direct, casting distinct shadows from the birds and the parking lines. The overall composition is simple and focused, with the birds as the central subject. The color palette is dominated by shades of gray and white, with a subtle hint of brown in the distant background, likely trees. The image evokes a sense of quiet observation, highlighting the vulnerability and stillness of the birds within an urban environment.",

Three gray seagulls are huddled closely together on the asphalt, their dark beaks and legs contrasting sharply against the lighter gray.

Three seagulls are the main focus, positioned along painted white parking space lines.

A third seagull stands slightly apart, appearing more alert with its head raised. The asphalt surface is a medium gray, showing some texture and minor imperfections. The white parking lines provide a strong linear element, bisecting the frame and leading the eye. The lighting appears to be bright and direct, casting noticeable shadows from the birds, suggesting a sunny day. The overall composition is simple and minimalist, with the birds as the central subjects against the expansive gray background.
