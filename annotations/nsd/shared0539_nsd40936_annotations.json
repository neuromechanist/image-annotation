The floor is covered in a repeating, light green chevron pattern, creating a geometric effect. The desk itself is a simple, light-colored wooden construction with four sturdy legs. A silver laptop is prominently positioned on the desk, displaying a desktop background of a dramatic, dark gray sky filled with swirling clouds. \n\nBeside the laptop sits a silver mouse, a black coffee cup with a cartoon image on it, a small ashtray containing a cigarette, and a small, gray desk organizer. The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting natural light coming from a window. The overall composition is slightly chaotic, with items scattered across the surface, giving the impression of a workspace in the midst of use. The color palette is dominated by greens, grays, and browns, creating a muted and somewhat subdued atmosphere.",

A black mouse rests beside it, seemingly ready for use.
