She stands on a metal railing, wearing a dark, possibly black, jacket with a white scarf around her neck and sunglasses. Her hair is pulled back into a bun. She is holding a smartphone up to her eye, framing the powerful waterfall. \n\nThe dominant element is the immense Niagara Falls, a massive curtain of white water cascading dramatically down into the churning turquoise water below. The water is intensely white and frothy, contrasting sharply with the darker hues of the rocks and vegetation on the far side of the falls. The lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting an overcast day, casting a gentle glow on the water and the woman. \n\nThe composition is balanced, with the woman positioned slightly to the right, drawing the eye towards the falls. The railing and the surrounding greenery provide a natural frame, emphasizing the scale and power of the natural spectacle. The overall impression is one of awe and a desire to capture this incredible natural wonder.",

A woman with dark, pulled-back hair and sunglasses is positioned on the railing, actively taking a photograph with a smartphone. She's wearing a black jacket and a white scarf, adding a touch of contrast to the scene. The railing itself is slightly blurred, suggesting motion or depth of field. \n\nBehind the woman, the immense power of Niagara Falls is the dominant background element. A massive curtain of water cascades down with incredible force, creating a dense, white spray that fills the lower portion of the frame. The water obscures much of the distant landscape, but glimpses of green trees and a stone structure can be seen beyond the falls. The woman is positioned to capture this spectacle, highlighting the scale and raw power of the natural phenomenon.
