The primary subject is a seagull, mid-flight, with its wings fully extended and slightly angled upwards. The seagull is predominantly a pale, warm beige color, with intricate patterns of darker brown feathers visible on its wings and head. Its beak is a darker gray, and its eye is a small, dark spot. \n\nThe seagull is set against a deep, shimmering blue ocean, likely a coastal scene. The water is rippled, creating a sense of movement and reflecting the sunlight, adding a subtle golden hue to the surface. The lighting appears to be bright and sunny, casting a strong reflection of the seagull directly below it. The composition is centered around the bird, drawing the viewer's eye immediately to its graceful flight.
