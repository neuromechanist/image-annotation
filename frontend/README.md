# The Annotation Garden Project - Frontend

A modern AI-powered dashboard for browsing and analyzing NSD (Natural Scene Dataset) images with multiple vision model annotations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Copy static assets (images & annotations)
npm run copy-assets

# 3. Start development server
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the dashboard.

## 📦 Deployment

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build and export static site for GitHub Pages
npm run build:static

# This will:
# 1. Copy all required assets to public/
# 2. Build the Next.js app
# 3. Export as static HTML to out/
```

### Manual Deployment to GitHub Pages

```bash
# Deploy to GitHub Pages (after building)
npm run deploy
```

The site will be available at: https://neuromechanist.github.io/hed-image-annotation

## 🎨 Features

- **Modern UI**: Dark theme with purple gradients and glassmorphism effects
- **Multi-Model Support**: Browse annotations from different AI vision models
- **Dynamic Analysis Types**: Multiple prompt types per model
- **Structured Data View**: Toggle between text and JSON views
- **Performance Metrics**: View token usage and processing times
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized layout for different screen sizes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys to navigate images

## 🔧 Configuration

The dashboard expects the following structure in the parent directory:

```
hed-image-annotation/
├── images/
│   └── downsampled/      # Downsampled NSD images
├── data/
│   └── thumbnails/       # Generated thumbnails
└── annotations/
    └── nsd/              # JSON annotation files
```

## 📝 Asset Preparation

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. **Downsampled images** in `../images/downsampled/`
2. **Thumbnails** in `../data/thumbnails/`
3. **Annotations** in `../annotations/nsd/`

Run `npm run copy-assets` to copy these to the public folder.

## 🚢 GitHub Actions Deployment

The project includes automated deployment via GitHub Actions. On push to main branch:

1. Assets are automatically copied
2. Site is built as static HTML
3. Deployed to GitHub Pages

See `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for details.
